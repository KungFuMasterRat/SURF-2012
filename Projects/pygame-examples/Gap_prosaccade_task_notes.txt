Gap prosaccade task:

Target= cross hairs
Cue= little orange box


-> Begins with the target at central fixation.
-> After 2.0-2.5 second interval, the target is extinguished

-> 200 msec stimulus free gap
-> +/- 4 degree peripheral target appears

-> After 500 msec, target returns to central fixation

CATCH TRIALS
-> No peripheral target and the central fixation reappears after a 700msec gap


What I should program:
3 separate pygames called "Gap_Prosaccade_plusfour", "Gap_Prosaccade_minusfour", "Gap_Prosaccade_catch"


Question: Can four degrees be out farther or is it stuck with the same radius? 
It shouldn't be stuck with the same radius.



So, thinking... How would I do this:
Need something that represents cross hairs on a screen
I can program it to set/present instead of respawning different location. This might be easier than writing 
a loop to have it respawn with different radius?

HOW MANY TRIALS ARE THERE:
HOW IS IT BEING PSEUDORANDOMIZED:
