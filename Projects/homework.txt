given a radius and a random degree write a python sub routine that returns the x and y coorinates 
convert from polar to cartesian. width dive by two and height div by two gives center mark, then plus x and y gives you where you really want the box to appear
x,y -> x+(w/2), y+(h/2)
radius and degree to x and a y 

def polar2cart(r, degree): ##mathland: 0,0 is origin, but in oygame 0,0 is top left

second assignment:
make text appear in pygame
